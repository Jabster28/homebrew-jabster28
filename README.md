# Jabster28 

just a bunch of scripts (some made by me) that iâ€™d like to be able to easily install.

## cool but how do i use them?

`brew install jabster28/jabster28/<formula>`

or you could `brew tap jabster28/jabster28` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation 

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
